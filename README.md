# UR Renderer

The UR Renderer is a very minimal library for rendering a simple 3d game in a very small file size. The goal is to have something that can be reused for game jams such as JS13k.

This project has begun as the extraction and reworking of the renderer from the masterful game [Underrun](https://github.com/phoboslab/underrun), by [Dominic Szablewski](https://github.com/phoboslab).
